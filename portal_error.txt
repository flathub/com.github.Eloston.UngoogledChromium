Your Flatpak version does not support a feature needed for this Chromium Flatpak
to run. This generally happens when your distribution has unprivileged user
namespaces disabled.

========== FOR DEBIAN USERS ==========

If the distro you are currently using is Debian Buster (10) or Sid, then this
has already been fixed in the latest system updates. If you are using Buster,
install the 'bubblewrap' and 'flatpak' from the buster-backports repository;
guidance on setting up backports is available at the following URL:

https://backports.debian.org/Instructions/

For older Debian versions or other Debian-based distros, you can run the
following commands as root (you can enter a root shell via 'sudo -i'):

dpkg-statoverride --update --add root root 0750 /usr/bin/bwrap
echo kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1 > /etc/sysctl.d/50-bubblewrap.conf
sudo sysctl -w kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1

========== FOR OTHER DISTROS =========

If you installed a "hardened" security kernel, these also usually disable
unprivileged user namespaces. They can be re-enabled by running the following
as root (you can enter a root shell via 'sudo -i'):

echo kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1 > /etc/sysctl.d/50-bubblewrap.conf
sudo sysctl -w kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1

If 'ls -l /usr/bin/bwrap' contains 'rws', then bwrap is also setuid. This can be
removed, if present, via:

sudo chmod u-s /usr/bin/bwrap

However, note that the permissions may be overridden on the next update of your
distro's bubblewrap package.
