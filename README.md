## Package Renaming Notice

This package was previously [`com.github.Eloston.UngoogledChromium`](https://github.com/flathub/com.github.Eloston.UngoogledChromium),
but was renamed to [`io.github.ungoogled_software.ungoogled_chromium`](https://github.com/flathub/io.github.ungoogled_software.ungoogled_chromium).

If you are using the old package, you will be promoted to move to the
new package when doing a `flatpak update`. Your files will be
migrated automatically, so you won't lose any browser data, but you might need to migrate your flatpak overrides manually if you have any.

The reason for the migration was to reflect the move of the project
from [Eloston](https://github.com/Eloston)'s personal GitHub account to the [ungoogled-software organization](https://github.com/ungoogled-software) and to verify the flatpak.
