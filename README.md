For more information about the ungoogled-chromium flatpak, please check the [official repository](
    https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium-flatpak) on GitHub.

## URGENT PLEASE READ THIS

Update to the new package name `io.github.ungoogled_software.ungoogled_chromium` as the old package name `com.github.Eloston.UngoogledChromium` will be deprecated soon. You could do that without losing your data by running `flatpak update` and accepting this prompt:

```
Info: app com.github.Eloston.UngoogledChromium branch stable is end-of-life, in
favor of io.github.ungoogled_software.ungoogled_chromium branch stable
Replace? [Y/n]:
```

The reason for the migration was to reflect the move of the project
from [Eloston](https://github.com/Eloston)'s personal GitHub account to the [ungoogled-software organization](https://github.com/ungoogled-software) and to verify the flatpak.
